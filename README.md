# React JS Amazon Clone - Clever Programmer

React app built by following the [How to Make an AMAZON Clone with REACT JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_IYL9ZMR_Y) tutorial by [Clever Programmer](https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/). Adapted to be written entirely in TypeScript.

In this project I learned the basics of:

- React Context API ([React Context with useReducer and Typescript](https://dev.to/elisealcala/react-context-with-usereducer-and-typescript-4obm) article helped with adaptation for TypeScript)
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)

It would be nice to add:

- persisting the basket between refreshes, perhaps assigning the basket to the user if they're logged in

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
